It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,\nDISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n0.\n\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1.\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2.\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na)\n\n       The modified work must itself be a software library.\nb)\n\n       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nc)\n\n       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nd)\n\n       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n       in the event an application does not supply such function or\n       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n       its purpose remains meaningful.\n       \n\n       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n       application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n       root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\nreasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\nthis License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\ndistribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same\nsections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\ndistribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\npermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\neach and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\nthe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\nbased on the Library.\n\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\nthe Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\nor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\nthis License.\n\n3.\n\nYou may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n4.\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5.\n\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n6.\n\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\na)\n Accompany the work with the complete\n    corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library\n    including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be\n    distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an\n    executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n    machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code\n    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and\n    then relink to produce a modified executable containing the\n    modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the\n    contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily\n    be able to recompile the application to use the modified\n    definitions.)\nb)\n Use a suitable shared library mechanism\n    for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that\n    (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\n    user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into\n    the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified\n    version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the\n    modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the\n    work was made with.\nc)\n Accompany the work with a written offer,\n    valid for at least three years, to give the same user the\n    materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\nd)\n If distribution of the work is made by\n    offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\n    access to copy the above specified materials from the same\n    place.\ne)\n Verify that the user has already received\n    a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user\n    a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n7.\n You may place library facilities that are a work\nbased on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with\nother library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\nsuch a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of\nthe work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is\notherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\na)\n Accompany the combined library with a copy\n    of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other\n    library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of\n    the Sections above.\nb)\n Give prominent notice with the combined\n    library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the\n    Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined\n    form of the same work.\n8.\n You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,\nor distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this\nLicense.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link\nwith, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have\nreceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\ncompliance.\n\n9.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n10.\n\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n11.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12.\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n13.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n14.\n\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n15.\n\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New\nLibraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\nCopyright (C) \nyear\nname of author\n\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Contributor Grant.\nSubject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You\n  a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n \nunder intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n   Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\n   distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on\n   an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger\n   Work; and\n  \nunder Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of\n   Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its\n   Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for\n   sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor\n   (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor\n   with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\n  \nthe licenses granted in Sections 2.2\n   (\na\n) and 2.2 (\nb\n) are effective\n   on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.\n  \nNotwithstanding Section 2.2 (\nb\n)\n   above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from\n   the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements\n   caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of\n   Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the\n   Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code\n   in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n \n3. Distribution Obligations.\n3.1. Application of License.\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms\n  of this License, including without limitation Section \n2.2\n. The\n  Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License\n  or a future version of this License released under Section \n6.1\n,\n  and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or\n  restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.\n  However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n  Section \n3.5\n.\n \n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in\n  Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable\n  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\n  must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular\n  Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring\n  that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\n  Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n \n3.3. Description of Modifications.\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the\n  changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a\n  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n  Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in\n  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation\n  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n \n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n(a) Third Party Claims\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property\n  rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections\n  \n2.1\n or \n2.2\n, Contributor must include a\n  text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\n  Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in\n  Section \n3.2\n, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in\n  all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as\n  notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\n  received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n \n(b) Contributor APIs\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor\n  has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that\n  \nAPI\n, Contributor must also include this information in the\n  \nlegal\n file.\n \n(c) Representations.\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4\n  (\na\n) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications\n  are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the\n  rights conveyed by this License.\n \n3.5. Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in \nExhibit A\n in each file of the\n  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to\n  its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more\n  Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n  \nExhibit A\n. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to\n  Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\n  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so\n  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n  must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n  as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n \n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections\n  \n3.1\n, \n3.2\n,\n  \n3.3\n, \n3.4\n and\n  \n3.5\n have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a\n  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms\n  of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations\n  of Section \n3.2\n. The notice must be conspicuously included in any\n  notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of\n  Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this\n  License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n  recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If\n  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely\n  clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the\n  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n  a result of any such terms You offer.\n \n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the\n  terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,\n  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n \n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to\n  some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:\n  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe\n  the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the\n  \nlegal\n file described in Section\n  \n3.4\n and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\n  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n \n5. Application of this License.\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in\n  \nExhibit A\n and to related Covered Code.\n \n6. Versions of the License.\n6.1. New Versions\nNetscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised and/or new versions\n  of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n \n6.2. Effect of New Versions\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may\n  always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such\n  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.\n  No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code\n  created under this License.\n \n6.3. Derivative Works\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to\n apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)\n rename Your license so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"MPL\",\n \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that\n your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of\n the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public\n License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the\n notice described in \nExhibit A\n shall not of themselves be deemed to\n be modifications of this License.)\n \n7. \nDisclaimer of warranty\nCovered code is provided under this license on an \"as is\"\n  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without\n  limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a\n  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of\n  the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you\n  (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary\n  servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part\n  of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this\n  disclaimer.\n8. Termination\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach\n  within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which\n  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by\n  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n \n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n  claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor\n  (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to\n  as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n \nsuch Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n   infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under\n   Sections \n2.1\n and/or \n2.2\n of this\n   License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if\n   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay\n   Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of\n   Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with\n   respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of\n   notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n   writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by\n   Participant to You under Sections \n2.1\n and/or\n   \n2.2\n automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day\n   notice period specified above.\n  \nany software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n   Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights\n   granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(\nb\n)\n   and 2.2(\nb\n) are revoked effective as of the date You first\n   made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n \n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n  alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes\n  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n  granted by such Participant under Sections \n2.1\n or\n  \n2.2\n shall be taken into account in determining the amount or\n  value of any payment or license.\n \n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections\n  \n8.1\n or \n8.2\n above, all end user\n  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly\n  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n  termination.\n \n9. \nLimitation of liability\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether\n  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer,\n  any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any of\n  such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or\n  consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss\n  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n  commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the\n  possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability\n  for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent\n  applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion\n  or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation\n  may not apply to you.\n10. \nU.S.\n government end users\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48\n  \nC.F.R.\n 2.101 (\nOct.\n 1995), consisting of\n  \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n  terms are used in 48 \nC.F.R.\n 12.212 (\nSept.\n\n  1995). Consistent with 48 \nC.F.R.\n 12.212 and 48 \nC.F.R.\n\n  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all \nU.S.\n Government End Users\n  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n \n11. Miscellaneous\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If\n  any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be\n  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\n  governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to\n  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or\n  registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to\n  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the\n  Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,\n  with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court\n  costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United\n  Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n \n12. Responsibility for claims\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for\n  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights\n  under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n \n13. Multiple-licensed code\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n  \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits\n  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the \nMPL\n\n  or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file\n  described in \nExhibit A\n.\n \nExhibit A - Mozilla Public License.\n\"The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\nVersion 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\ncompliance with the License.

        "licenseText": "GNU General Public License, version 2,\n\nwith the Classpath Exception\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\nmost of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\ncan do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\nshow them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\neveryone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n    this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.

It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead of this License.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\nonly where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\nthe words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\nexception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n\n    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n\n    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING\n\nCertain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,\nbased on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the\nGNU Classpath Exception.\n\nNote that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software\npackage.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed\nincompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.\nFor example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache\nLicense, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed\nto you under their original licenses.\n\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the\nClasspath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits\nyou to use that code in combination with other independent modules not\nlicensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to\ncommingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed\ncode by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also\ncontaining Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.\n\nAdditionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the\nfiles to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be\nrequired to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under\nthe GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms\nof some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further\ndistribute the package.\n\nFailing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create\nunexpected legal consequences.\n\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer\nskilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or\nmaking modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed\nand/or involve the use of third party software.\n\nWorkshop\nOpenJDK FAQ\nInstalling\nContributing\nSponsoring\nDevelopers' Guide\nVulnerabilities\nMailing lists\nIRC\n\n                      · \nWiki\nBylaws\n · \nCensus\nLegal\nJEP Process\nSource code\nMercurial\nBundles (\n6\n)\nGroups\n(overview)\n2D Graphics\nAdoption\nAWT\nBuild\nCompatibility & Specification Review\nCompiler\nConformance\nCore Libraries\nGoverning Board\nHotSpot\nIDE Tooling & Support\nInternationalization\nJMX\nMembers\nNetworking\nPorters\nQuality\nSecurity\nServiceability\nSound\nSwing\nVulnerability\nWeb\nProjects\n(overview)\nAmber\nAnnotations Pipeline 2.0\nAudio Engine\nBuild Infrastructure\nCaciocavallo\nClosures\nCode Tools\nCoin\nCommon VM Interface\nCompiler Grammar\nDetroit\nDevelopers' Guide\nDevice I/O\nDuke\nFont Scaler\nFramebuffer Toolkit\nGraal\nGraphics Rasterizer\nHarfBuzz Integration\nIcedTea\nJDK 6\nJDK 7\nJDK 7 Updates\nJDK 8\nJDK 8 Updates\nJDK 9\nJDK\n\n      (…\n       \n14\n,\n       \n15\n,\n       \n16\n)\nJDK Updates\nJavaDoc.Next\nJigsaw\nKona\nKulla\nLambda\nLanai\nLocale Enhancement\nLoom\nMemory Model Update\nMetropolis\nMission Control\nModules\nMulti-Language VM\nNashorn\nNew I/O\nOpenJFX\nPanama\nPenrose\nPort: AArch32\nPort: AArch64\nPort: BSD\nPort: Haiku\nPort: Mac OS X\nPort: MIPS\nPort: Mobile\nPort: PowerPC/AIX\nPort: s390x\nPortola\nSCTP\nSkara\nShenandoah\nSumatra\nThreeTen\nTiered Attribution\nTsan\nType Annotations\nXRender Pipeline\nValhalla\nVerona\nVisualVM\nZero\nZGC\nTools\nJava SE\nMercurial\njtreg harness\nRelated\njava.sun.com\nJava Community Process\nJDK GA/EA Builds\n\n\n        © 2020 Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates\n        \nTerms of Use\n\n        ·\n        \n            License: \nGPLv2\n\n        · \nPrivacy\n\n        · \nTrademarks\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\nmost of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\ncan do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\nshow them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\neveryone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n    this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works.

Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6.

It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\nmost of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\ncan do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\nshow them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\neveryone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n    this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\nwhich everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.

If you do not wish to do\n    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING\n\nCertain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,\nbased on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the\nGNU Classpath Exception.\n\nNote that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software\npackage.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed\nincompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.\nFor example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache\nLicense, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed\nto you under their original licenses.\n\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the\nClasspath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits\nyou to use that code in combination with other independent modules not\nlicensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to\ncommingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed\ncode by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also\ncontaining Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.\n\nAdditionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the\nfiles to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be\nrequired to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under\nthe GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms\nof some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further\ndistribute the package.\n\nFailing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create\nunexpected legal consequences.\n\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer\nskilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or\nmaking modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed\nand/or involve the use of third party software.\n\nWorkshop\nOpenJDK FAQ\nInstalling\nContributing\nSponsoring\nDevelopers' Guide\nVulnerabilities\nMailing lists\nIRC\n\n                      · \nWiki\nBylaws\n · \nCensus\nLegal\nJEP Process\nSource code\nMercurial\nBundles (\n6\n)\nGroups\n(overview)\n2D Graphics\nAdoption\nAWT\nBuild\nCompatibility & Specification Review\nCompiler\nConformance\nCore Libraries\nGoverning Board\nHotSpot\nIDE Tooling & Support\nInternationalization\nJMX\nMembers\nNetworking\nPorters\nQuality\nSecurity\nServiceability\nSound\nSwing\nVulnerability\nWeb\nProjects\n(overview)\nAmber\nAnnotations Pipeline 2.0\nAudio Engine\nBuild Infrastructure\nCaciocavallo\nClosures\nCode Tools\nCoin\nCommon VM Interface\nCompiler Grammar\nDetroit\nDevelopers' Guide\nDevice I/O\nDuke\nFont Scaler\nFramebuffer Toolkit\nGraal\nGraphics Rasterizer\nHarfBuzz Integration\nIcedTea\nJDK 6\nJDK 7\nJDK 7 Updates\nJDK 8\nJDK 8 Updates\nJDK 9\nJDK\n\n      (…\n       \n14\n,\n       \n15\n,\n       \n16\n)\nJDK Updates\nJavaDoc.Next\nJigsaw\nKona\nKulla\nLambda\nLanai\nLocale Enhancement\nLoom\nMemory Model Update\nMetropolis\nMission Control\nModules\nMulti-Language VM\nNashorn\nNew I/O\nOpenJFX\nPanama\nPenrose\nPort: AArch32\nPort: AArch64\nPort: BSD\nPort: Haiku\nPort: Mac OS X\nPort: MIPS\nPort: Mobile\nPort: PowerPC/AIX\nPort: s390x\nPortola\nSCTP\nSkara\nShenandoah\nSumatra\nThreeTen\nTiered Attribution\nTsan\nType Annotations\nXRender Pipeline\nValhalla\nVerona\nVisualVM\nZero\nZGC\nTools\nJava SE\nMercurial\njtreg harness\nRelated\njava.sun.com\nJava Community Process\nJDK GA/EA Builds\n\n\n        © 2020 Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates\n        \nTerms of Use\n\n        ·\n        \n            License: \nGPLv2\n\n        · \nPrivacy\n\n        · \nTrademarks\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it.

The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n    this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\nwhich everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n    more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\nstarts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n    type 'show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\nis a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead of this License.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\nonly where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\nthe words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\nexception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n\n    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n    a combined work based on this library.

An independent\n    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.
